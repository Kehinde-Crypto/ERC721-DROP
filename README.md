## 🧑‍💻 About the Project  
The **ERC721-DROP** project leverages the ERC721 token standard to enable NFT creators to deploy and distribute NFTs easily. This implementation supports minting for individual users, airdrops to multiple addresses, and royalty configurations.  

Whether you're building an NFT collection or exploring blockchain development, this repository provides a solid foundation for your projects.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- **ERC721 Compliant:** Fully adheres to the ERC721 standard.  
- **Minting:** Supports single and batch minting.  
- **Airdrop Capability:** Easily airdrop NFTs to multiple recipients.  
- **Custom Metadata:** Integrate IPFS or other decentralized storage for metadata.  
- **Royalty Support:** Configure royalties for secondary sales.  
- **Upgradeable Contract:** Built with flexibility to support upgrades (optional).  

---

## ✅ Prerequisites  
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- **Node.js:** v16 or later  
- **Foundry:** Installed via [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html)  
- **Thirdweb CLI:** Installed via `npm install -g @thirdweb-dev/cli`  
- **MetaMask Wallet:** To interact with your deployed contract  
- **A Code Editor:** (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Kehinde-Crypto/ERC721-DROP.git  
cd ERC721-DROP  
```  

### 2. Install Dependencies  
```bash  
npm install  
forge install  
```  

### 3. Configure Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:  
```bash  
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-wallet-private-key>  
RPC_URL=<network-rpc-url>  
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed-contract-address>  
```  

### 4. Compile Contracts  
Compile the Solidity contracts using Forge:  
```bash  
forge build  
```  

---

## 📋 Usage  

### Minting NFTs  
- Mint a single NFT:  
```bash  
forge script ./scripts/mintNFT.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>  
```  

- Batch mint NFTs:  
Use the airdrop functionality to mint multiple NFTs at once.  

### Interacting with the Contract  
Thirdweb provides a CLI to interact with your contract:  
```bash  
thirdweb-cli call <function-name> <parameters>  
```  

---

## 🌍 Deployment  

### Deploying with Forge  
```bash  
forge script ./scripts/deploy.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast  
```  

### Deploying with Thirdweb  
Thirdweb allows for faster deployment with its tools:  
```bash  
thirdweb deploy  
```
